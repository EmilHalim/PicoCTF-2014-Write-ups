CTFs, or Capture-The-Flags, are computer security competitions where contestants must solve challenges to find a flag (typically a string). These challenges can range in subject and difficulty from reverse engineering files to exploiting buffer overflows. [PicoCTF](http://picoctf.com) is a CTF created by student-run organizations at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml) targetted towards middle and high schoolers.

We are Steam Locomotive, a team of 5 high school students from the [Liberal Arts and Science Academy](http://lasaonline.org) in Austin, TX. Over the past two weeks in Pico, we've acumlated 4985 points and finished in 14th place.

This [GitBook](http://gitbook.io)'s goal is to contain comprehensive,complete set of write-ups for all of the challenges in PicoCTF 2014. It is a constant work in progress, so if a write-up is not posted immediately, don't worry! We are working as fast as possible to add all of the problems, and should have them done within a couple weeks.

Lastly, we would like to thank the creators of PicoCTF for the competition, all the participants of PicoCTF, and our sister team, Team Evan, for contributing to the write-ups.
