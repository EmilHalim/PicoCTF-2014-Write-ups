CTFs, or Capture-The-Flags, are computer security competitions where contestants must solve challenges to find a flag (typically a string). These challenges can range in subject and difficulty from reverse engineering files to exploiting buffer overflows. [PicoCTF](http://picoctf.com) is a CTF created by student-run organizations at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml) targetted towards middle and high schoolers.

We are Steam Locomotive, a team of 5 high school students from the [Liberal Arts and Science Academy](http://lasaonline.org) in Austin, TX. We are:

* Ehsan Asdar - [Oksisane](https://github.com/oksisane)
* Neil Patil - [patil215](https://github.com/patil215)
* Sam Grayson - [GladiusMaximus](https://github.com/gladiusmaximus)
* Evan Tey - [evantey14](https://github.com/evantey14)
* Nha Nguyen - [zicez](https://github.com/zicez)

Over the past two weeks competing, we've accumulated a total of 4985 points and finished in 14th? place.

This [GitBook](http://gitbook.io) contains write-ups of the challenges we solved.

We'd would like to thank the creators of PicoCTF for the competition, all the participants of PicoCTF, and our sister team, Team Evan, for contributing to the write-ups.
