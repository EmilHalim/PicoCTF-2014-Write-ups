THE AUTHORIZATION CODE IS WITHALLTHECOLORSOFTHEWIND

YOU THINK IM AN IGNORANT SAVAGE
AND YOUVE BEEN SO MANY PLACES
I GUESS IT MUST BE SO
MBUT STILL I CANNOT SEE
IF THE SAVAGE ONE IS ME
HOW CAN THERE BE SO MUCH THAT YOU DONT KNOW
YOU DONT KNOW

YOU THINK YOU OWN WHATEVER LAND YOU LAND ON
THE EARTH IS JUST A DEAD THING YOU CAN CLAIM
BUT I KNOW EVERY ROCK AND TREE AND CREATURE
HAS A LIFE HAS A SPIRIT HAS A NAME

YOU THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE PEOPLE
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LOOK AND THINK LIKE YOU
BUT IF YOU WALK THE FOOTSTEPS OF A STRANGER
YOULL LEARN THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW YOU NEVER KNEW

HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE WOLF CRY TO THE BLUE CORN MOON
OR ASKED THE GRINNING BOBCAT WHY HE GRINNED
CAN YOU SING WITH ALL THE VOICES OF THE MOUNTAINS
CAN YOU PAINT WITH ALL THE COLORS OF THE WIND
CAN YOU PAINT WITH ALL THE COLORS OF THE WIND

COME RUN THE HIDDEN PINE TRAILS OF THE FOREST
COME TASTE THE SUNSWEET BERRIES OF THE EARTH
COME ROLL IN ALL THE RICHES ALL AROUND YOU
AND FOR ONCE NEVER WONDER WHAT THEYRE WORTH

THE RAINSTORM AND THE RIVER ARE MY BROTHERS
THE HERON AND THE OTTER ARE MY FRIENDS
AND WE ARE ALL CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
IN A CIRCLE IN A HOOP THAT NEVER ENDS

HOW HIGH WILL THE SYCAMORE GROW
IF YOU CUT IT DOWN THEN YOULL NEVER KNOW
AND YOULL NEVER HEAR THE WOLF CRY TO THE BLUE CORN MOON

FOR WHETHER WE ARE WHITE OR COPPER SKINNED
WE NEED TO SING WITH ALL THE VOICES OF THE MOUNTAINS
WE NEED TO PAINT WITH ALL THE COLORS OF THE WIND

YOU CAN OWN THE EARTH AND STILL
ALL YOULL OWN IS EARTH UNTIL
YOU CAN PAINT WITH ALL THE COLORS OF THE WIND
