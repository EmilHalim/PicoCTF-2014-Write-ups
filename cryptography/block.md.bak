### Problem ###

Daedalus Corp has been using this script to encrypt it's data!  We think this
file contains a password to their command server. Can you crack it?

## Answer ##

### Overview ###

Find the keys through brute force using meet in the middle attack.

### Details ###

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
A special trait of substitution-permutation network is that even if an adversary obtains the text and the cipher text it's still impossible to figure out the key used to encrypted. Thus, we have to brute force the key, but a key in this case is only 2^24 bits long which is very brute force-able. Although, the encryption uses two keys, so one would think that 2^48 calculation is needed crack the key. This is where [meet in the middle attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack) comes in.

The encryption used is called
[substitution-permutation network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution-permutation_network),
and the encryption algorithm is properly implemented. However, the python
program adds "message: " to the beginning of every data being encrypted. Check
out line 96 in the python program. This means that we know the text and the
cipher text of the first 8 characters of the encrypted file. But we only need
the first 3 characters to figure out the key because the encryption encrypts
three characters at a time.

A special trait of substitution-permutation network is that even if an
adversary obtain the text and the cipher text it's still impossible to figure
out the key without brute force. Thus, we have to brute force the key, but a key
in this case is only $2^24$ bits long which is very brute force-able. Although,
the encryption uses two keys, so one would think that $2^48$ calculation is
needed crack the key. This is where
[meet in the middle attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack)
comes in.

Since we have the text and the cipher, we can use meet in the middle to reduces
the amount of calculation needed to crack both keys.

The encryption algorithm does this:

    Text ---- encryption with key 1 ---> (something) ---- encryption with key 2 ---> Ciphertext

The attack works by creating a table of all possible value of (something) with
all the possible combinations of key 1. Then we decrypt the ciphertext by
guessing value of key 2 back and cross checking the resulting value with the
table generated with key 1. When we get a match of what we decrypted with a
value in the table generated, we will find out the correct value of key 1 and
key 2. 

Meet in the middle attack:

    Text ----- some key 1 ----> (something) == (something) <------ some key 2 ---- Ciphertext

Instead of doing $2^48$ calculations, we have essentially done two $2^24$
calculations instead which is only $2^25$ calculations. This is an example of a
time to memory trade off. It takes much less time, but it involves storing a
$2^24$ long dictionary. 

Here is some python code

```python
plain_text = 'message: '
cipher_text = '\xa1\x98\xa4\x03\x85\x81\xc5\x10\x9e'

a = {}
for i in xrange(0, 16**6):
    a[encrypt_data(plaintext, i)] = i


for i in xrange(0, 16**6):
    try:
        print ('{0:d} {1:d}'.format(a[decrypt_data(cipher_text, i)], i))
    except KeyError:
        pass
```

With the keys, it's trivial to decrypt the file and get the flag.

Running this in pypy is significantly faster than running with vanilla
python. Pypy is a drop in replacement for python that is much faster. With the
keys, it's trivial to decrypt the file and get the flag.
