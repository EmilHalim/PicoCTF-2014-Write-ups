### Problem

The CD you find has a copy of your father's website: [homepage.html](https://picoctf.com/api/autogen/serve/homepage.html?static=false&pid=3099c443d360a2514f17f155fb65d5d2). Maybe something is hidden in the site...

### Hint

You may want to use your browser to view the source of the web page.

## Answer

###Overview

Look through the page source for the flag.

###Details

In most browsers, you can view a page's HTML source code in Chrome or Firefox by pressing `Ctrl+U` . When we do this on [homepage.html](https://picoctf.com/api/autogen/serve/homepage.html?static=false&pid=3099c443d360a2514f17f155fb65d5d2), we see

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Dr. Claudio Drake's Personal Website</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<center>
			<div style="width: 500px">
				<h1>Dr. Claudio Drake</h1>
				<img src="/problem-static/web/no-comment/me.png">
				<p>
					I am a roboticist with a Doctorate Degree in Robotics. My primary interests are in developing new medical robotics to help doctors
better perform surgery on high risk patients.
				</p>

			</div>
		</center>
	</body>
</html>
```

In the HTML comment, we see our flag. HTML comments are not rendered to the screen, but still exist in the source code.
