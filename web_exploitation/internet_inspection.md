### Hint

It may be helpful to learn how to 'Inspect Elements' in your browser.

## Answer

###Overview

Inspect the table to find the flag.

###Details

The hint is to learn how to 'Inspect Elements' in browser. For most browsers, this can be done by right-clicking over the element and selecting "Inspect Element."

When we do this on the chequered box, we see a div with a chequered background image and z-index:100. This means the div is blocking the following div from view. As we look into the div that is blocked, we find a table that contains
```html
<td>flag_793a6a0aa4aa27947641fcb84ead650a6113ab6d</td>
```

###Flag
flag_793a6a0aa4aa27947641fcb84ead650a6113ab6d
