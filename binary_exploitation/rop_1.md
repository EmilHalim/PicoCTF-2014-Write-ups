## ROP 1 - 100 (Binary Exploitation) ##
#### Writeup by Oksisane

### Problem ###

This binary is running on a machine with ASLR! Can you bypass it? The binary can be found at `/home/rop1/` on the shell server. The source can be found [here](https://picoctf.com/problem-static/binary/rop1/rop1.c).



### Hint ###

ASLR is hard to beat if you need to predict an address, but what if you don't? What does %eax contain when vuln returns? Is there any code in the program which calls or jumps to it?


## Answer ##

### Overview ###

Implement use [ROP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming) techniques to write and execute you'r own shellcode while defeating aslr.
